MISCT is an open-world space game where you do missions to repair your broken spacecraft. During your experience, you will encounter several aliens to help you find your missing pieces of your ship. The mind-boggling puzzles will make you rack your brain for ideas as you desperately attempt to solve them. You will have to figure out how the game ends for yourself...
